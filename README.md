## Time Complexity of Insertion Sort

- Best case: O(n) , If the list is already sorted, where n is the number of elements in the list.
- Average case: O(n^2 ) , If the list is randomly ordered
- Worst case: O(n^2 ) , If the list is in reverse order

## Advantages of Insertion Sort:

- Simple and easy to implement.
- Stable sorting algorithm.
- Efficient for small lists and nearly sorted lists.
- Space-efficient.
- Adoptive. the number of inversions is directly proportional to number of swaps. For example, no swapping happens for a sorted array and it takes O(n) time only.

## Disadvantages of Insertion Sort:

- Inefficient for large lists.
- Not as efficient as other sorting algorithms (e.g., merge sort, quick sort) for most cases.
